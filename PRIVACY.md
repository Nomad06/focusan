# Focusan Privacy Policy

**Last Updated: January 9, 2026**
**Version: 2.0.0**

## Overview

Focusan is committed to protecting your privacy. This extension operates entirely within your browser and does not collect, transmit, or share any personal data with external servers or third parties.

## Information We Collect

Focusan stores the following data **locally in your browser only**:

### User Configuration Data
- **Blocked websites list**: Domain names you choose to block
- **Site categories**: Optional categorization of blocked sites
- **Blocking schedules**: Time-based rules you configure
- **Conditional rules**: Visit limits and advanced blocking conditions
- **Focus session preferences**: Sites selected for Pomodoro-style sessions
- **Language preference**: Your chosen interface language (Russian/English)

### Usage Statistics (Local Only)
- **Visit attempt counts**: Number of times you tried to access blocked sites
- **Focus session history**: Duration and completion of your focus sessions
- **Achievement progress**: Your progress in the gamification system

### Temporary Data
- **Temporary allowances**: Time-limited exceptions you create
- **Active focus sessions**: Current session state and timer

## How We Store Your Data

All data is stored using Chrome's built-in storage APIs:

- **chrome.storage.sync**: For blocked sites, settings, and preferences (synced across your Chrome browsers if you're signed in)
- **chrome.storage.local**: For statistics, temporary allowances, and session data (stored only on this device)

**Important**: Chrome's sync storage has quotas (approximately 100KB total). If you block many sites, you may hit this limit. The extension will continue to work, but sync may be limited.

## Data Transmission

**Focusan does NOT**:
- ❌ Send data to external servers
- ❌ Use analytics or tracking services
- ❌ Communicate with any third-party services
- ❌ Collect personally identifiable information
- ❌ Monitor your browsing beyond blocked site detection
- ❌ Share data with advertisers or data brokers
- ❌ Use cookies or web beacons

**All functionality operates entirely within your browser.**

Focusan requests the following Chrome permissions. Here's why each is needed:

| Permission | Purpose | Data Access |

| `storage` | Save your blocked sites and settings | Local storage only |
| `tabs` | Detect which website you're visiting to apply blocking rules | Current tab URL only when navigating |
| `declarativeNetRequest` | Block network requests to distracting sites | URL patterns you configure |
| `notifications` | Show alerts when focus sessions start/end | No data access |
| `webNavigation` | Block single-page applications (e.g., YouTube video changes) | Navigation events for blocked sites only |

## Data Security

While Focusan doesn't transmit data externally, we implement security best practices:
- **Input validation**: All user inputs are validated using Zod schemas
- **Type safety**: TypeScript ensures data type correctness
- **No eval()**: No dynamic code execution
- **Sanitized storage**: Data is normalized before storage to prevent injection

- ✅ **Access**: Export all your data anytime
- ✅ **Rectification**: Edit your blocked sites and settings
- ✅ **Erasure**: Delete individual items or uninstall completely
- ✅ **Portability**: Export data in JSON format

Since all data is local and under your control, you can exercise these rights directly within the extension.
