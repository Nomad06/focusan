## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Sites Not Blocking?
1. Check if site is in your blocked list (Options → Sites)
2. Verify schedule is active (if using schedules)
3. Check for temporary allowances
4. Visit diagnostics page: `chrome-extension://[your-id]/src/pages/diagnostics/index.html`

### Focus Session Not Starting?
1. Ensure you have sites selected
2. Check alarm permissions are granted
3. Look for notifications (may be blocked by browser)

### Statistics Not Updating?
1. Statistics only count actual blocking attempts
2. Check the Stats tab in Options
3. Data stored locally - clearing browser data will reset

### Import Failed?
1. Ensure JSON file is from Focusan export
2. Check file is not corrupted
3. Try exporting again from another browser
